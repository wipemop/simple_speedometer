# Finalized version uploaded as v1.1.
The plugin is considered feature-complete (for now anyway), and is henceforth available for a direct download from the Nexus library (as of today, April 10th, 2025 - just in time for SAB)

## Coordinate Set status and custom coordinates.json sharing
Right now only a very few Coordinate Sets are available from internal data. On first load the plugin will create a coordinates.json for you, which you can freely edit using the in-game editor. Eventually I want to expand on available Sets both in internal data as well as by making a curated coordinates.json available on the releases page. You can freely share your coordinates.json with fellow community members in the meantime, there is no personal data included. Now go create some cool Coordinate Sets and breathe some life into dusty old JPs and race tracks!

## Antivirus antics
Unfortunately there have been some cases of false positive detections by Antivirus software that ended up in local deletion of the plugin. Rest assured, there is no evil doing in my humble plugin, and the more people use it, eventually it stops being an issue.

As always never blindly trust a random person on the internet, so if you want to really make sure that it is safe, please feel free to read through the code and compiling it locally instead of loading the .dll from here or Nexus.

## Incompetence disclaimer
I made this plugin for fun using my own ideas. But to translate them into code i had to make heavy use of ChatGPT. As such the code will likely not measure up to certain standards or conjectures, and I am sorry for all the coders that might turn in their graves.

### Thanks a lot for your understanding. I hope you will have a use for this, and fun doing so!
